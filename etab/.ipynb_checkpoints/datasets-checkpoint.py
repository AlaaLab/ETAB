    The EchoNet dataset, introduced in [1, 2], comprises one apical-4 chamber (AP4CH) 2D gray-scale video is extracted from each echo study. 
    A total of 10,036 videos are collected from 10,036 distinct individuals who underwent echocardiography between 2006 and 2018 as part of 
    routine care at a University Hospital. Individuals in the data set were selected at random from hospital records cardiac function assessments 
    and calculations obtained by a registered sonographer and verified by a level-3 echocardiographer are provided. 
    
    Data is accessible via: https://echonet.github.io/echoNet/.
    
    The "echonet" class is part of the etab.datasets module and contains the functionalities required for loading and processing the EchoNet data set.
