This repository contains code for a suite of benchmarks that can be used to evaluate visual representations of cardiac ultrasound (echocardiogram) data with respect to various clinically-relevant tasks using publicly accessible data sets. In addition, the repo contains a unified evaluation protocol, which we call the echocardiographic task adaptation benchmark (ETAB), that measures how well a visual representation of echocardiograms generalizes to common downstream tasks of interest.
