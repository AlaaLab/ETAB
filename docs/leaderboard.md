In many cases, we might be interested in evaluating a visual representation pre-trained on an external data set with respect to their ability to capture all relevant features in echocardiograms. These pre-trained representations might have been trained on private echocardiogram data, data for other cardiac imaging modalities, or even a general visual representation pre-trained on non-medical data such as ImageNet. The ETAB evaluation protocol uses the suite of benchmark tasks listed in the previous Section to evaluate the usefulness of any given (pre-trained) visual representation for a wide variety of common tasks in echocardiography. In this Section, we describe the ETAB evaluation protocol and provide code snippets illustrating how the user can compute the "ETAB score" for a pre-trained backbone representation.
